				<outline text="Why Do We have MT Principles?">
					<outline text="WHAT GOT US HERE WON"T GET AS THERE">
						<outline text="MT is looking how to get "THERE"">
							<outline text="Moving test from cost center to cost benefit "></outline>
							<outline text="Being Force multiplier"></outline>
						</outline>
					</outline>
					<outline text="Software is much easier to produce"></outline>
					<outline text="Thanks to advancements in Continuous Delivery, the customer has much more options to choose from">
						<outline text="Companies are shipping faster"></outline>
					</outline>
					<outline text="It's much easier to compete with any company">
						<outline text="For customers, the switching cost has gone way down"></outline>
					</outline>
				</outline>
				<outline text="The principles are not just theory">
					<outline text="They are based on Experience and observation"></outline>
				</outline>
				<outline text="Why modern testing">
					<outline text="To make contrast with Traditional ">
						<outline text="Traditional testing is not only a cost but also delay "></outline>
					</outline>
				</outline>
				<outline text="Principle 1">
					<outline text="Our priority is improving the business.">
						<outline text="
What it means to improve the business?">
							<outline text="MTer needs to be seen as positive influence"></outline>
							<outline text="Boiling Frogs">
								<outline text="Adoption has to be gradual "></outline>
							</outline>
							<outline text="Delta from Idea to deployments is rapid "></outline>
							<outline text="Get that mvp out with just enough quality to get feedback from customers "></outline>
							<outline text="“You don’t get value from engineering effort until it is in customer hands”">
								<outline text="Think not only how to get it out but what’s next "></outline>
							</outline>
							<outline text="No one tests your product better than your customer">
								<outline text="what in case of software houses? They don't have product per se"></outline>
							</outline>
							<outline text="There are bugs and bugs that customer cares about "></outline>
							<outline text="The GOAL">
								<outline text="Short Term">
									<outline text="Provide Value to customer Frequently"></outline>
								</outline>
								<outline text="Long Term">
									<outline text="Making sure Principle are Followed"></outline>
								</outline>
							</outline>
						</outline>
					</outline>
				</outline>
				<outline text="Principle 2">
					<outline text="We accelerate the team, and use models like Lean Thinking and the Theory of Constraints to help identify, prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system.">
						<outline text="WHAT">
							<outline text="Our goal is to accelerate team ">
								<outline text="that doesn't mean "we have to go fast"">
									<outline text="Instead we are force multiplier"></outline>
								</outline>
							</outline>
							<outline text="its about">
								<outline text="adaptiblity"></outline>
								<outline text="Reaction"></outline>
								<outline text="???">
									<outline text="Brent went on tagnent and never finished his thought."></outline>
								</outline>
							</outline>
							<outline text="Lean Principles">
								<outline text="Deliver fast by managing the flow "></outline>
							</outline>
							<outline text="Books to read">
								<outline text="The Goal: A Business Graphic Novel"></outline>
								<outline text="Phonix Project"></outline>
								<outline text="Lean Thinking"></outline>
							</outline>
						</outline>
						<outline text="WHY">
							<outline text="Don’t forget MT context"></outline>
							<outline text="By focusing the MT Practitioner on identifying their role as acceleration” ">
								<outline text="this model were chosen because they are proven"></outline>
							</outline>
							<outline text="It’s important cause far to much of The TEST is reverse of this">
								<outline text="they create the bottleneck instead of resolving them">
									<outline text="Example: stabilization period just before release"></outline>
									<outline text="It’s easier to "build quality In" instead of trying to test "quality in""></outline>
									<outline text="Test Complete date ">
										<outline text="No i don't mean the tool"></outline>
										<outline text="“If you test after test complete you will find bugs and that will cause us to miss the deadline""></outline>
									</outline>
								</outline>
							</outline>
						</outline>
						<outline text="HOW">
							<outline text="This mantra is About completion and predictability not about value in order to accelerate you need mechanism to identify what value is and what the next bottleneck">
								<outline text="Mt don’t want testing to be viewed as bottle neck "></outline>
							</outline>
							<outline text="Quality is problem solved to humans being"></outline>
							<outline text="Fast feedback loop is critical in context of understanding what is quality "></outline>
							<outline text="By Balancing fallacy of value with failure to launch"></outline>

							<outline text="1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."></outline>
							<outline text="2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."></outline>
							<outline text="3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."></outline>
							<outline text="4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."></outline>
							<outline text="5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."></outline>
							<outline text="6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."></outline>
							<outline text="7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress."></outline>
							<outline text="8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."></outline>
							<outline text="9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."></outline>
							<outline text="10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential."></outline>
							<outline text="11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."></outline>
							<outline text="12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."></outline>
